The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly reshaped urban mobility. During the lockdown, workers teleworked if
possible and left home only for essential activities. Our study investigates the spatial patterns of essential travel
and their socioeconomic differences during the COVID-19 lockdown phase in comparison with the same period
in 2019. Using data from Columbus, Ohio, we categorized travelers into high, moderate, and low socioeconomic
status (SES) clusters and modeled travel demand of SES clusters for both phases using spatially weighted
interaction models. Then, we characterized the SES variability in essential travel based on frequently visited
business activities from each cluster. Results suggest that disparities in travel across SES clusters that existed
prior to COVID-19 were exacerbated during the pandemic lockdown. The diffused travel pattern of high and
moderate SES clusters became localized and the preexisting localized travel pattern of low SES clusters became
diffused. During the lockdown, the low and moderate SES clusters traveled mostly for work with long- and
medium-distance trips, respectively, whereas the high SES cluster traveled mostly for recreational and other
nonwork purposes with short-distance trips. This study draws some conclusions and implications to help
researchers and practitioners plan for resilient and economically vibrant transportation systems in response to
future shocks.
