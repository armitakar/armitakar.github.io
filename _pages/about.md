<p align="justify"> Welcome! I am a transportation geographer researching <i><u>human mobility (accessibility and travel behavior)</u></i> as performance indicators of <u><i>equity, environment, and health</i></u> using <u><i>geospatial data science</i></u>. Currently, I serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Geoinformation Science at George Mason University. I completed my Ph.D. in Geography at The Ohio State University in 2023, my Master's in Geography and GIS at the University of Utah in 2019, and Bachelor's in Urban and Regional Planning from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2015.</p>


<p align="justify"> I am a passionate advocate for transit and pedestrian-friendly transportation systems, actively dedicated to promoting sustainable travel environments within our communities. My doctoral dissertation focuses on pioneering a novel concept and measure known as <i>inclusive accessibility</i>. This approach integrates peopleâ€™s diverse travel choices and experiences into advancing space-time accessibility models. I posit this measure as a more realistic and socially aware representation of accessibility, as it distinguishes between the geographic spaces that are physically and perceptually accessible to individuals and social groups. My PhD dissertation also demonstrates application of <i>inclusive accessibility</i> approach in tailoring transportation infrastructure interventions specific to marginalized communities.</p>

<p align="justify"> In addition, most of my research fall under the umbrella of social equity. I explore the socio-economic differences and its underlying inequalities in travel patterns and food and healthcare access. Besides, investigating community resilience during disruptions is another significant contribution of my research. I conduct research on how marginalized communities were disproportionally affected during COVID-19 and other climatic events. </p>

<p align="justify"> I have expertise in GIScience, data science and space-time modeling in addressing complex social science problems. My research uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, neural networks, and few-shot learning techniques), statistical models (e.g., bayesian model, multilevel model, hurdle model, and GLMs), spatial and space-time analytics (e.g., spatially weighted interaction models, space-time regression kriging, space-time accessibility) and network analytics and optimization algorithms. </p>
