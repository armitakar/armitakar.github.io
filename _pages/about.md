<p align="justify"> Welcome! I am a transportation geographer researching <i><u>human mobility (accessibility and travel behavior)</u></i> as performance indicators of <u><i>equity, environment, and health</i></u> using <u><i>geospatial data science</i></u>. Currently, I serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Geoinformation Science at George Mason University. I completed my Ph.D. in Geography at The Ohio State University in 2023, my Master's in Geography and GIS at the University of Utah in 2019, and Bachelor's in Urban and Regional Planning from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2015.</p>


<p align="justify"> My research explores the complex social, environmental, and health challenges around human mobility. I am specifically interested in understanding how the existing travel environment, explicitly through its physical characteristics and implicitly through shaping individualsâ€™ perceptions and lived experiences, leads to different forms of mobility inequities. I leverage geospatial data science, space-time modeling, and network analytics to advance methods identifying data-driven, human-centered transportation solutions, aiming to foster safer, healthier, and more equitable travel environments.  
  
My research answers three overarching questions:

#<p align="center"> <img src="/images/Inclusive access.png" style = "border:0"> </p>
#<p font size = "8" align="center"><i> The figure illustrates geographic variations in walking perceptions between high-income white men and low-income women of color, along with its influence on the inclusive access measure for these respective social groups. </i></p>

<p align="justify"> In addition, most of my research fall under the umbrella of social equity. I explore the socio-economic differences and its underlying inequalities in travel patterns and food and healthcare access. Besides, investigating community resilience during disruptions is another significant contribution of my research. I conduct research on how marginalized communities were disproportionally affected during COVID-19 and other climatic events. </p>

<p align="justify"> I have expertise in GIScience, data science and space-time modeling in addressing complex social science problems. My research uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, neural networks, and few-shot learning techniques), statistical models (e.g., bayesian model, multilevel model, hurdle model, and GLMs), spatial and space-time analytics (e.g., spatially weighted interaction models, space-time regression kriging, space-time accessibility) and network analytics and optimization algorithms. </p>
