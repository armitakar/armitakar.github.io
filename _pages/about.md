<p align="justify"> Welcome! I am a GIScientist and transportation geographer researching the complex interactions between human mobility, environment, safety, and health. Currently, I serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Geoinformation Science at George Mason University. I completed my Ph.D. in Geography at The Ohio State University in 2023, my Master's in Geography and GIS at the University of Utah in 2019, and Bachelor's in Urban and Regional Planning from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2015.</p>


<p align="justify"> My research lies at the intersection of GIScience, transportation geography, cognitive and behavioral geography, and health and safety. I am specifically interested in modelling and understanding how urban environments and human experiences around them shape accessibility and travel behavior, along with their safety and health outcomes across diverse population groups. My work integrates geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), space–time modeling, network analytics, and citizen science to advance data-driven, human-centered, and inclusive solutions to safety and health challenges around existing transportation systems.</p>


<p align="justify">My current research answers three main questions:</p>


1.	<p align="justify"><b>How can we combine multi-sensory data, large language models, and agentic AI to better characterize multimodal transportation environments and human experiences?</p>


2.	<p align="justify"><b>How can we leverage spatio-temporal AI models to detect and predict actual and perceived road risks, and thereby support safe infrastructure design, planning, and decision-making?</p>


3.	<p align="justify"><b>How can we integrate space-time accessibility measures, spatial interaction models, and geostatistics to reveal spatio-social barriers of healthcare access and travel?</p>


<p align="justify"> My work has been published in several high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, including <i>Annals of the American Association of Geographers (AAG), Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, Transportation Research Part D, Applied Geography, Journal of Transport Geography, Transportation Research Record (TRR), Risk Analysis,</i> and <i>Atmospheric Environment</i>. I received several awards for my work, including <i>the Postdoc Idea Award from the NCH Abigail Wexner Research Institute, the E. Willard and Ruby S. Miller Scholarship from The Ohio State University, the Student Dissertation Award from the Sustainability Institute at The Ohio State University,</i> and <i>the Prime Minister Gold Medal from the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh</i>.</p>

<p align="justify">This summer, I had the opportunity to mentor 5 high-school and one undergraduate student through the GMU Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program (ASSIP). Just within six weeks, these students successfully completed the following projects, including data collection, processing, modeling, and preparing the final presentation for each:
<p>- Healthcare Deserts in Virginia: Rural-Urban and Socioeconomic Disparities in Access to Care (Sarah Zak and Stepan Mkrtchian) </p>
<p>- How Do Women Access Maternal Care? Spatial and Social Dimensions of Maternal Healthcare Visits in Florida (Ava Hudson and Justin Yu) </p>
<p>- Developing a Fairfax Topographic Accessibility Map (Kevin Hasani) </p>
<p>- Crime Around Public Transit: Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Variations in Crime Rates Near D.C. Bus Stops (Monisha Preetham).</p>
