Welcome! I am a post-doctoral research scientist at the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital. I completed my Ph.D. in Geography at The Ohio State University in 2023, my Master's in Geography and GIS at the University of Utah in 2019, and Bachelor's in Urban and Regional Planning from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2015. My research interests include: <u>1. Human mobility (multimodal accessibility and travel behavior), 2. Sustainability, social equity and resilience, and public health 3. Geospatial data science and space-time modeling</u>. I have publications in several well-reputed peer-reviewed journals, including <i> Transportation Research Part D, Annals of the American Association of Geographers (AAG), Applied Geography, Transportation Research Record (TRR), and Risk Analysis</i>.

I am a transit and ped-bike enthusiast and work actively in promoting a sustainable travel environment for our communities. In my PhD dissertation, I design an inclusive accessibility measure that considers varied travel choices and experiences across individuals and social groups into advancing multimodal accessibility models. In addition, most of my research fall under the umbrella of social equity. I explore the socio-economic differences and its underlying inequalities in travel patterns and food and healthcare access. Besides, investigating community resilience during disruptions is another significant contribution of my research. I conduct research on how marginalized communities were disproportionally affected during COVID-19 and other climatic events.

I have expertise in GIScience, data science and space-time modeling in addressing complex social science problems. My research uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, neural networks, and few-shot learning techniques), statistical models (e.g., bayesian model, multilevel model, hurdle model, and GLMs), spatial and space-time analytics (e.g., spatially weighted interaction models, space-time regression kriging, space-time accessibility) and network analytics and optimization algorithms.
