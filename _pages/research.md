<b>Doctoral Dissertation: Inclusive Accessibility</b>
My doctoral dissertation focuses on pioneering a novel concept and measure known as inclusive accessibility. This approach integrates people’s diverse travel choices and experiences into advancing space-time accessibility models. I posit this measure as a more realistic and socially aware representation of accessibility, as it distinguishes between the geographic spaces that are physically and perceptually accessible to individuals and social groups. My PhD dissertation also demonstrates application of inclusive accessibility approach in tailoring transportation infrastructure interventions specific to marginalized communities.
